### main check

Here's what's happening:

1. In Python, `__name__` is a special variable that:
    - Equals "__main__" when the file is run directly
    - Equals the module's name when the file is imported

2. if `__name__` == "`__main__`": is used to:
    - Run code only when the file is executed directly
    - Skip code when the file is imported as a module

Common uses:

```python
if `__name__` == "`__main__`":
    # Put test code here
    # Put example usage
    # Put command-line interface code
```

This pattern allows you to:

- Write reusable modules with functions/classes
- Include test code in the same file
- Make files that can work both as modules and standalone scripts

In the example:

- When running `main_check.py` directly: `__name__` == "`__main__`", so test code runs
- When importing `main_check.py`: `__name__` == "`main_check`", so test code is skipped

This is a Python best practice that helps you:

- Keep test code with your module
- Prevent test code from running when importing
- Make modules more reusable
